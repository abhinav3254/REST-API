When an API is considered as REST API

1. separate API into logical resources.
2. Expose structured resource-based URLs.
3. use HTTP methods(verbs)
4. Be stateless.



explaination of each points in in-depth

1. meaning :- This means that we must separate the data i.e. - category
assume our api is of tour and travels :- it will have
        a. destination
        b. cost
        c. hotel
        d. resturant
        etc there will be some other features also available
    example : https://www.abhinav.com/addNEWTOUR
    here this whole is called URL and the addNEWTOUR is called as end point 

Note down this disturbs the 3 point which is use HTTP methods so to overcome this thing we have to use these
/addNEWTOUR  --> POST/ tours  no id will be given
/ getTours  --> GET /tours  (GET is method)

this will return all the data from the database so if we want some specific data then we have to put id at the end

GET /tours/7
7 is the tour id

FOR update we use PUT or PATCH method
FOR delete we use DELETE method
